## Done:

- Oleg Tinkov — «I’m Just Like Anyone Else» (2015): Bullshit. He is not common. Then everyone would
  be with $1.7BN.
- Oleg Tinkov — «How to become a businessman» (2012): Liked.
- Dossie Easton — «The Ethical Slut» (2007): Fucking «sofa» psychology again. But I agree with the
  main idea.
- Sergej Viktorovich Jarov — «Everyday life of besieged Leningrad» (2013): A lot of reasoning,
  analysis, the author’s attitude to documents. Don’t like.
- Lidija Alekseevna Nevzorova — «School’s trimming theory and practice» (2010): Disagree that «shod
  horses must not be healthy». A farrier should read this to know the enemy in his face. The book
  has many colored illustrations and this is very good. And too many PATHOS: School, School’s
  Trimming Theory, School’s Method… Ugh!
- Lidija Alekseevna Nevzorova — «How to achieve balance» (2009): The same. PATHOS, shoeing is evil.
  But written very good about the balance: anyone should understand.
- Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov — «Russian general memoirs» (2014): Very interesting. Horrors of war
  described very gently: «up to 400 souls of all ages and both sexes were massacred with the loss of
  two people». There is also criticism of Yermolov from his contemporaries, which does not make him
  so ideal.
- Dean McLaughlin — «Hawk Among the Sparrows» (1992): An unobtrusive science fiction novella about
  the weapons of the future against the weapons of the past. The main idea: «All in good time».
- Sergei Donatovich Dovlatov — «Pushkin Hills» (2016): Venechka is not on the train. And no recipes.
- Sergei Donatovich Dovlatov — «The Zone: A Prison Camp Guard's Story» (1982): Boredom. It is
  written about people, not about the zone. But I read it anyway.
- Anton Viktorovich Krotov — «Practice of free travels» (2015): A very useful book not only for a
  hitchhiker but also for any person, interestingly written.
- Andrzej Sapkowski — «The Witcher»: Good fantasy.

## Failed:

- Andrei Andreyevich Gromyko — «Memoirs» (1988): I finished only one volume. It’s very interesting,
  but it’s too boring. Like the Bible. I thought about Soviet politicians, like Novoseltsev: «…you
  are a rusk!…There is nothing human in you!…There is no heart in you because you have only numbers
  and reports…». This book showed me that at least Gromyko was a very interesting person.
- Thomas Metzinger — «The Ego Tunnel»: Tired on page 21, too difficult for me.
