I continued my trips. In this time I took a better car (BMW) to make the ride even more interesting.

First
number – [Chapsky palace in Priluki](<https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%94%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%86_%D0%A7%D0%B0%D0%BF%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%85_(%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%83%D0%BA%D0%B8)>).

The impression of the palace is depressing – everything is very bad there: as always, there is no
infrastructure, the territory is dirty, the palace itself is in a fucking state.

The ‘Plant Protection Institute’ is good at protecting plants, but not the palace. The coolest thing
I saw was a young toad.

There are many cats here. You can go to feed and pet the cats.

Further – the Chapsky Park in Stankovo.

Everything is the same here. Devastation.

It’s better not to look at anything up closely. The buildings are disfigured by the “remake”,
neglected, crumbling.

But from afar, everything, as usual, is fine. In short, you should go there and immediately go to
the pier to just look into the distance. So much cooler.

![Fck. Part two.](IMG_0757.jpg)

While driving ‘from point A to point B’, I was reached 200 on the highway. Got a ban. Sad but
honest. On the other hand, why else would you take a BMW, no matter to race?
