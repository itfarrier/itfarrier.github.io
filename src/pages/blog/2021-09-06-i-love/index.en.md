I visited the oldest city in Belarus.

A very cool solution to build a modern panel shit in the form of Novopolotsk without shitting
Polotsk. As a result, there was a tourist town.

I also looked at the filming site of Belarusfilm. There is nothing to watch, of course.

And here is the first love. Orsha turned out to be not as a prison as I expected. Although, far from
the castle, the city is very bad.

Shklov looks more like a village than a city. The feeling is that after the construction of the town
hall in the 18th century, nothing else was done.

Near the Shklov I saw something wonderful. But for sure from the word ‘apple’…

Then I accidentally saw these ruins and had to turn around. A sign with the form of a shield
attracted my attention. Nothing remained of the city. You can only visit this place to be sad about
what we have lost.

Another love follows. Very boring.

The swamps were not so boring. Car sharing spoiled everything. I drove into the forest about 7
meters and suffered for a long time by blocking the car and unlocking it afterward with a good
mobile connection. Got a lesson not to drive into the forest on a sharing.

And finally, the city where the most interesting thing is the factory.

In general, driving to all these assholes is very interesting, although you don’t see anything
interesting there. That’s weird.
