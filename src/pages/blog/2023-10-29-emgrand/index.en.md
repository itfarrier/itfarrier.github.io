![When you're cute!](IMG_6176.jpg)

Quite soft and comfortable, good light, beautiful. Disgusting multimedia, no CarPlay and has just
“mirroring” the screen. And also the climate: when you set it to the coldest position, then the air
conditioner must be turned on by hand (WTF?), unobvious and inconvenient cruise, when the increase
and decrease always by 1 km&#x2F;h. The display is crap, dim, with poor resolution. Well, too
“thoughtful” gearbox in normal mode, you can only drive in sport. But beautiful.
