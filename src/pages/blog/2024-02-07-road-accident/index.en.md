So, I’m not a virgin now! My first car accident…

I was driving home and it was snowing. The navigator suggested that there was an accident ahead in the right lane (there
were three lanes in total), and I was driving in the middle. Having almost reached the place with the accident, I became
curious about what happened there, turned my head to the right, and when I looked ahead, ~~what the fuck~~ I saw a red
traffic light ahead and two cars there in my lane and in the lane to the left.

Hit the brakes…

ABS crunched…

I realized that I was fucked, but something clicked in my head and I turned left and drove between the cars…

Silence…

Hit…

Stop.

I turned on the emergency lights, took out my documents, put on my jacket and got out of the car. The drivers of both
cars came out and almost in unison said:

> Well, you’re fucked… We have everything intact. Look at yours…

My car was also intact. They just touched the mirrors. In the end, we simply went in our own ways without any
complaints.

This time I was lucky…

P.S. Are there too many ellipses?..
