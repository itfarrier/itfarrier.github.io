title: 'Triple duplication or paranoia'
type: post

I was looking for a method for automatic backup through CWM and found
[Online Nandroid Backup \* ROOT](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.h3r3t1c.onnandbup). I read about the
danger of live file system backups but my device is officially supported and I’ve tested several live backups restoring.
No problems.

Finally, I have recurring backups through
[Titanium Backup ★ root](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keramidas.TitaniumBackup), Online Nandroid
Backup \* ROOT, and standard android. This is paranoia, isn’t it?
