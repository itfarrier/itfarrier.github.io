I see ads about how it’s good in many places. So, it’s true. Awesome for $89. But I was irritated ’cause of Cyanogen OS.
It is based on CM but contains much bloatware as any stock firmware. So, I should do geek stuff: unlock the bootloader,
replace recovery, replace firmware to CM. A little con is no physical button on phone. It shows on display. So, I’m
nervous.
