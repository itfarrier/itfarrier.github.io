First, the spray pools of CHP‐5.

To look at them, you need to go to the restricted area. It’s funny.

In general, there is nothing to look at. Just take pictures with streams of water. On the leeward
side, the heat transferred to the air from the water is clearly felt. As a result, there is a
bizarre sensation of heat from the wind and simultaneous coolness from the drops that fly to you.

Then I rushed to Logoisk park. Water lilies met me.

![Hi.](IMG_0831.JPG)

Then ducks appeared, which are almost not afraid of people.

In the deep of the park, there are cool cascades in the hollow. I wish I could be here during the
fog. It should be creepy.

And then I remembered that I had never been to Khatyn.

Upon arrival, the size of the parking is striking. It is huge.

And then you understand the scale of the whole complex when you see the main alley.

When you walk, you start to hear bells ringing. At first, I thought that it seemed to me. But, no,
it repeats itself and gets louder as you go through the alley.

The ringing, of course, creates the necessary feelings, instills some kind of anxiety. And in
combination with the reading of the names of the victims, it is terrifying.

In general, this is so far the only place where there is infrastructure: parking, navigation,
toilets, where they regularly clean and keep everything in order. It is very pleasant to visit just
such places, you know right away. It would be like this everywhere in Belarus…
