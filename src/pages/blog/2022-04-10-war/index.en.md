I was going to write on 3rd of March, but I am writing on 10th of April.

A lot of things have already been said about the war, but the imperial ambitions in Russia still
piss me off the most — to be respected, to be afraid, to be the biggest (although this is already
true). There would be no way to develop what we have now, Putin goes to fight in a neighboring
country. > 30 years have passed since the dissolution of the USSR, > 20 since the beginning of
Putinism, and the result is FUCKING NOTHING. As the country lived in shit, so it lives now. Putin,
die, fucked up…
