Almost half a year I completely switched to the Linux.

Pros:

- Free. The most important for me. ~~’cause I’m poor~~

- Possibility for «nerding». I use it instead of games.

- HYPOTHETICAL possibility for security audit of source code. It’s impossible for the regular human
  being.

- Deep customizing possibility.

- Better working with TOR, I2P, CJDNS etc. It just works.

- Package manager for upgrading the whole system with all apps.

Cons:

- Bored wallpapers.
