title: First
---

I wanted to write a personal ~~shit~~blog. So, where’s the start? From blog hostings, of course. But
that’s not for Jedi. I want MY OWN blog with my own domain name. Denied. Further, sure,
[Wordpress](https://wordpress.org). Tried all of this under the light of the
<abbr title="LAMP = Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP">LAMP</abbr>: chosen the theme, installed some
plugins. Need a hosting. And here I understood that I don’t want to pay ’cause I’m poor. And I
started looking for a freeway.

I invented some ways: free hosting or on my own PC. Free hostings scared my paranoia. LAMP remote
setup on my own PC was to difficult for me. And I found in Google that I can use
[GitHub](https://github.com) as a hosting. And galloped… Static site generator
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) was googled. Tried. Beautiful, free, but difficult. Let’s google
again… And I found [Octopress](https://octopress.org), [Ruhoh](https://github.com/ruhoh/ruhoh.rb),
[Hexo](https://hexo.io) as special static site generators for blogs. Let’s roll.

Ruhoh seemed complicated to me again – too little ~~wallpapers~~ themes. Hexo – I had problems with
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) on my OS (probably problems with /dev/hands). I choosed Octopress as a
result. Many plugins out of the box and good default theme with huge amount community themes and
plugins.

So, free hosting on GitHub (and all benefits from this huge project), beautiful HTML5 + CSS3
website, fast and reliable ’cause of its static nature.
