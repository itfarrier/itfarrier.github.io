I think all ISPs have something like this:

‘4.3.2 Temporarily in time with the highest Network loading throttle traffic speed for services that
use Network resources for access to P2P networks (including BitTorrent technology etc.), load big
size files and for access streaming resources (including audio‐ and video‐streaming) if using them
critically increase traffic volume and decrease traffic speed for others.’

I. e. they want that I use all insane megabytes and megabits of network speed only for email and
‘facebooks’. Fuck you all! TOR and I2P ‘will save the giant of thought’. Until they will filter them
too.
