I wanted to write a personal ~~shit~~blog. So, where’s the start? From blog hostings, of course. But
that’s not for Jedi. I want MY OWN blog with my own domain name. Denied. Further, sure,
<a href="https://wordpress. org">Wordpress</a>. Tried all of this under the light of the
«<acronym title="LAMP = Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP">LAMP</acronym>»: chosen the theme, installed some
plugins. Need a hosting. And here I understood that I don’t want to pay ’cause I’m poor. And I
started looking for a freeway.

I invented some ways: free hosting or on my own PC. Free hostings scared my paranoia.
«<acronym title="LAMP = Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP">LAMP</acronym>» remote setup on my own PC was to
difficult for me. And I found in Google that I can use GitHub as a hosting. And galloped... Static
site generator <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> was googled. Tried. Beautiful, free, but
difficult. Let’s google again... And I found <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>,
<a href="http://ruhoh.com">Ruhoh</a>, <a href="http://zespia.tw/hexo">Hexo</a> as special static
site generators for blogs. Let’s roll.

<a href="http://ruhoh.com">Ruhoh</a> seemed complicated to me again — too little ~~wallpapers~~
themes. <a href="http://zespia.tw/hexo">Hexo</a> — I had problems with
<a href="http://nodejs.org">Node. JS</a> on my OS (probably problems with /dev/hands). I choosed
<a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> as a result. Many plugins out of the box and good
default theme with huge amount community themes and plugins.

So, free hosting on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> (and all benefits from this huge
project), beautiful <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language, version 5">HTML5</abbr> +
<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, version 3">CSS3</abbr> website, fast and reliable ’cause of its
static nature.
