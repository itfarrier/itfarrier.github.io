Since some time, I decided to go to the office to increase my activity. So, it was warm sunny day
and I went home from work, but without glasses and lenses. I saw that cat stretched out on the
asphalt and rests.

> — Kitty! Kitty! Kitty!

It didn’t give me the time of day. I came closer. It was pot‐bellied.

And no reaction again.

I got closer and leaned over. A stench hit my nose…

Zero reaction, because she was corpse. Pot‐bellied — the corpse was inflated by gases.
