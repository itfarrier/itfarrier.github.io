title: 'Internet advertising'
---

I decided to reduce the number of adblocker subscriptions. Started to turn them off one to one and
was surprised â€™cause of becoming ads. It was everywhere: in the header, in the footer, in the
sidebar, between posts, and inside them.

Reverted subscriptions back. I prefer slow page loading instead of seeing ads. Every time when I see
a browser without an adblocker I was wondered how people may use it like this? Too much bullshit.
