title: 'New design of VK'

In 2016 (sic!) they FINALLY decided to increase the page width. Feedback in the beta test is
organized through the ass. In principle, they do not need to change the design either, but only to
make the width fit the screen size and fit the fonts to high resolutions. I hope they don’t mess up…
