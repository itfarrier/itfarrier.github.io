Tasted this sweetie. Very wide car. So wide thus I forced to see to the rearview mirrors very often.
And exterior. This car is very beautiful and aggressive. But Mustang is better for me: more
comfortable, with greater engine sound. ‘…3.5‐4 thousand RPM give such an ode to internal combustion
engines and petroleum products that no Tesla’s S trolleybus acceleration can compensate the pleasure
of this sound.’ — [alexmak](https://alexmak.net/2013/11/29/camaro-notes-p5)
