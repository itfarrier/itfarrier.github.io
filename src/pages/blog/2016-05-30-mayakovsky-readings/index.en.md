title: 'Mayakovsky Readings'

Here again ‘resurrected’ readings have passed, the second already. This time it was passed… It was
passed because raining. Instead of readings, it turned out to be a flat on Mayakovsky Square with
his monument in the rain.

I think that in such a case, the organizers need to carry a bust of Mayakovsky in their pockets,
place it where conditions are more comfortable, and conduct readings there (an alternative meeting
point in case of bad weather). The idea of grading the best is good, but I immediately thought:
‘What about the worst? They also need to be celebrated’. This time everyone could hearable and that,
of course, was awesome! That’s the reason why I didn’t like all the readers at the first event: I
couldn’t hear them.

Still, such an event should be more numerous.

Update: The worst readers should be given Dontsova’s book.
