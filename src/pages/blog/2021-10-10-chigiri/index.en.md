I heard phrase ‘in the chigiri’ at work. And didn’t understand. Of course, ask to explain. Later
found more explanations:

1. outskirts;
2. detour;
3. a place far from the center.

And, of course, I googled this phrase and found that this locale in the Belarus.

As you can see, I enjoy visiting such ‘forgotten’ places. As I understand myself, I like the
calmness in them, and the understanding also comes that I generally live very good when I see HOW
people live in such places.
