- Gorko! (2013) — I watched this movie again. And it’s cool. This movie is a warning for newlyweds
  (sic!) how their wedding shouldn’t look like.

- Wild Tales (2014) — This movie is very good for me. Plot and other details better to see in wiki.
  I immediately remembered “The Voroshilov Sharpshooter” by Govorukhin, “1210” by Gonchukov and “Law
  Abiding Citizen” with Butler. Generally, the main thought in all novels — person actions in
  extreme situation. Pros, in my opinion, in this almanac is not ~~146~~100% tragedy in each novel:
  it contains happy, fun and fantastic. In fun, I suppose, author compared heroes with ovises
  (Hello, “Modern Times”). So stupid it started, continued and finished. You should see.
