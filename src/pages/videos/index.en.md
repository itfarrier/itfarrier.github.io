- Movies about superheroes are all bullshit. I’ve just watched (well, simply jumped via whole film
  for 10 minutes) «Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016)» and «Captain America: Civil War
  (2016)».
- Gorko! (2013) — I watched this movie again. And it’s cool. This movie is a warning for newlyweds
  (sic!) how their wedding shouldn’t look like.
