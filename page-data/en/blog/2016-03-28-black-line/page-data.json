Obviously,\ntheir entrance was at the front but in this case, it was in the backyard. Some nonsense. The event was started from\nlyrics reading. And it was like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._5,_1948\">№ 5</a>. Sets of words where the meaning can\nsee only people with high‐level Zen. For example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And I liked everything. The poems got into the soul, made me think, and just reminded me what love is and the fact\nthat we are all equal. Some authors directly transferred fire to just their eyes, and when they began to read, my\nheart stopped, and then it beat sharply because the words reached the very depths of me. Special thanks to the vocals,\nvery strong voices, sonorous, bright, and clear. and finally, we come to the end. who stayed in recent times could\nfully experience the songs of their beloved Galina and go dancing the waltz or everyone’s favorite jazz or blues ❤\neverything was great!) Thank you for a fabulous evening ✨ You make people believe in life, and this is a lot, thanks\nto everyone who was on stage ✨</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Scary men… ‘<a href=\"https://vk.com/wall-115786413_36\">Another team</a>’ is closer to me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I should say you… It was a rape… Guys, are you listening to yourself??? Poets – everyone to the factory!!! Have you\nbeen told that poetry is not just a set of words? There, as it were, the meaning should at least slip through!\nTrees – there are no petitions to you (there is to sound engineer). Clouds!!! Vocals -??? Whaaat was that?. I will not\nsay anything to everyone who was there further, because it was unbearable. Sorry for being rude. But the listener must\nalso be respected. And that was a shame.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although I liked it and remembered lyrics about women and fire by the first poet that was presented as ‘fashion‐guru’ :)\nAfter all of the poets for whom I went to the concert, I’ve seen them – CSLT. CSLT burned, of course. If the audience\napplauded the poets for the sake of decency, then for them for 100%. Good job. By the way like on\n<a href=\"https://vk.com/a_shevelev\">Andrew’s</a> lection bassist was the loudest. :D And I bought his book:</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 3120px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/23074ecdc6e08c6c84f39f48b6ef6c01/1fc44/vyvihi.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 133.33333333333331%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/23074ecdc6e08c6c84f39f48b6ef6c01/f696c/vyvihi.avif 1920w,\n/static/23074ecdc6e08c6c84f39f48b6ef6c01/0bce3/vyvihi.avif 3120w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 3120px) 100vw, 3120px\"\n              type=\"image/avif\"\n            /><source\n              srcset=\"/static/23074ecdc6e08c6c84f39f48b6ef6c01/882b9/vyvihi.webp 1920w,\n/static/23074ecdc6e08c6c84f39f48b6ef6c01/c4c01/vyvihi.webp 3120w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 3120px) 100vw, 3120px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/23074ecdc6e08c6c84f39f48b6ef6c01/0f98f/vyvihi.jpg 1920w,\n/static/23074ecdc6e08c6c84f39f48b6ef6c01/1fc44/vyvihi.jpg 3120w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 3120px) 100vw, 3120px\"\n            type=\"image/jpeg\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/23074ecdc6e08c6c84f39f48b6ef6c01/1fc44/vyvihi.jpg\"\n            alt=\"Book by Sergey Cvetkov ‘Luxations’\"\n            title=\"\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\"><p>Book by Sergey Cvetkov ‘Luxations’</p></figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>I should say about the sound. Almost at the beginning of the concert, one of the poets dropped the microphone on the\nfloor and later it died while performing a song by the CSLT band. On the stage, there was a wire to one of the\nmicrophones, and when one of the musicians touched it, this immediately became known to everyone in the hall. The sound\nengineer screwed it up as he rehearsed it! Squeaks for the whole hall, then the voices are too loud, then too quiet,\nthen a mad echo, then some kind of interference… Awful! After CSLT was finished the performance I left the hall. Before\nleaving, I went to the toilet to piss and he welcomed me with the smell of piss and shit. Cultural fucking institution,\nshit, and their toilet wasn’t be cleaned. And I had to leave through the back door.</p>","id":"c1e33b00-fbc5-5a69-99df-d5000d2eb709"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"ITFarrier"}}},"pageContext":{"langKey":"en","language":"en","next":{"fields":{"langKey":"en","slug":"/en/blog/2016-04-01-differences/"},"frontmatter":{"language":null,"title":"Differences","type":"post"}},"previous":{"fields":{"langKey":"en","slug":"/en/blog/2016-03-16-wileyfox-swift/"},"frontmatter":{"language":null,"title":"Wileyfox Swift","type":"post"}},"slug":"/en/blog/2016-03-28-black-line/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2674376943","357539041","4035578580"],"slicesMap":{}}
