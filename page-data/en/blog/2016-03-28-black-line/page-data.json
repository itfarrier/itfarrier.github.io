Obviously, their entrance was at the front but in this case, it was in the backyard. Some\nnonsense. The event was started from lyrics reading. And it was like\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._5,_1948\">№ 5</a>. Sets of words where the meaning can see only\npeople with high‐level Zen. For example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And I liked everything. The poems got into the soul, made me think, and just reminded me what love\nis and the fact that we are all equal. Some authors directly transferred fire to just their eyes,\nand when they began to read, my heart stopped, and then it beat sharply because the words reached\nthe very depths of me. Special thanks to the vocals, very strong voices, sonorous, bright, and\nclear. and finally, we come to the end. who stayed in recent times could fully experience the\nsongs of their beloved Galina and go dancing the waltz or everyone’s favorite jazz or blues ❤\neverything was great!) Thank you for a fabulous evening ✨ You make people believe in life, and\nthis is a lot, thanks to everyone who was on stage ✨</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Scary men… ‘<a href=\"https://vk.com/wall-115786413_36\">Another team</a>’ is closer to me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I should say you… It was a rape… Guys, are you listening to yourself??? Poets – everyone to the\nfactory!!! Have you been told that poetry is not just a set of words? There, as it were, the\nmeaning should at least slip through! Trees – there are no petitions to you (there is to sound\nengineer). Clouds!!! Vocals -??? Whaaat was that?. I will not say anything to everyone who was\nthere further, because it was unbearable. Sorry for being rude. But the listener must also be\nrespected. And that was a shame.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although I liked it and remembered lyrics about women and fire by the first poet that was presented\nas ‘fashion‐guru’ :) After all of the poets for whom I went to the concert, I’ve seen them – CSLT.\nCSLT burned, of course. If the audience applauded the poets for the sake of decency, then for them\nfor 100%. Good job. By the way like on <a href=\"https://vk.com/a_shevelev\">Andrew’s</a> lection bassist was the\nloudest. :D And I bought his book:</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 3120px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/23074ecdc6e08c6c84f39f48b6ef6c01/1fc44/vyvihi.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 133.33333333333331%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/23074ecdc6e08c6c84f39f48b6ef6c01/f696c/vyvihi.avif 1920w,\n/static/23074ecdc6e08c6c84f39f48b6ef6c01/0bce3/vyvihi.avif 3120w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 3120px) 100vw, 3120px\"\n              type=\"image/avif\"\n            /><source\n              srcset=\"/static/23074ecdc6e08c6c84f39f48b6ef6c01/882b9/vyvihi.webp 1920w,\n/static/23074ecdc6e08c6c84f39f48b6ef6c01/c4c01/vyvihi.webp 3120w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 3120px) 100vw, 3120px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/23074ecdc6e08c6c84f39f48b6ef6c01/0f98f/vyvihi.jpg 1920w,\n/static/23074ecdc6e08c6c84f39f48b6ef6c01/1fc44/vyvihi.jpg 3120w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 3120px) 100vw, 3120px\"\n            type=\"image/jpeg\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/23074ecdc6e08c6c84f39f48b6ef6c01/1fc44/vyvihi.jpg\"\n            alt=\"Book by Sergey Cvetkov ‘Luxations’\"\n            title=\"Book by Sergey Cvetkov ‘Luxations’\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\"><p>Book by Sergey Cvetkov ‘Luxations’</p></figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>I should say about the sound. Almost at the beginning of the concert, one of the poets dropped the\nmicrophone on the floor and later it died while performing a song by the CSLT band. On the stage,\nthere was a wire to one of the microphones, and when one of the musicians touched it, this\nimmediately became known to everyone in the hall. The sound engineer screwed it up as he rehearsed\nit! Squeaks for the whole hall, then the voices are too loud, then too quiet, then a mad echo, then\nsome kind of interference… Awful! After CSLT was finished the performance I left the hall. Before\nleaving, I went to the toilet to piss and he welcomed me with the smell of piss and shit. Cultural\nfucking institution, shit, and their toilet wasn’t be cleaned. And I had to leave through the back\ndoor.</p>","id":"c1e33b00-fbc5-5a69-99df-d5000d2eb709"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"ITFarrier"}}},"pageContext":{"langKey":"en","language":"en","next":{"fields":{"langKey":"en","slug":"/en/blog/2016-04-01-differences/"},"frontmatter":{"language":null,"title":"Differences","type":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"langKey":"en","slug":"/en/blog/2016-03-16-wileyfox-swift/"},"frontmatter":{"language":null,"title":"Wileyfox Swift","type":null}},"slug":"/en/blog/2016-03-28-black-line/"}},
