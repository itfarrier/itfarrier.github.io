And now,\nmore than a month later, I’m ready to look at places from that article.</p>\n<p>I used the car sharing by <a href=\"https://any-time.by\">Anytime</a> as a transport. From the beginning, I\nblunted that the car starts only after the start of the sharing (support explained everything). On\nthe way, I saw a white stork’s nest with chicks.</p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_1410.jpg\" alt=\"And here they are.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_1411.jpg\" alt=\"And worse.\"></p>\n<p>The first point of the way was the ‘Holy Krinitsy’. I have already traveled here on a bike (where I\nmade figure‐eight on the back wheel and bent the derailleur hanger) but the trip was much nicer on\nthe car <del>whoever doubted</del>. It is quiet, calm in the krinitsy, but everything is spoiled by human\ngarbage and fallen trees that blocked the trail. The water tastes like iron.</p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_1426.jpg\" alt=\"The first spring. Ribbons evoke memories of Lake Baikal.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_1445.jpg\" alt=\"Gazebo near the second spring.\"></p>\n<p>The second point is the ‘Udranka Reservoir’. Its area is rather small, but it was enough to swim.\nThe dam was shitted with broken bottles.</p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_1455.jpg\" alt=\"Drainage from the dam with ducks. Broken bottles are lying on the ‘concrete’ on the right.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_1458.jpg\" alt=\"Canal.\"></p>\n<p>Number three – ‘Hydropark of the sanatorium “Sosnovy Bor”’. And here is even some kind of\ninfrastructure: boat rental, islands with barbecues and gazebos. Gazebos, by the way, are free for\nthe clients of the sanatorium and paid for everyone else. But, as usual in Belarus, if you want to\npay – <del>fuck off</del> you won’t find where. Most of all the joy is delivered by the suspension bridges\nand ducks.</p>\n<p>Four – ‘Ballast quarry’ near Vyazynka. I arrived but did not get through the checkpoint. WELL…</p>\n<p>Number five – ‘Rapid flow at Zaslavl’. The path ends with a very long lousy dirt road. But then you\ncan see the rapid flows and the animals that live here: a lot of frogs that jump out under your\nfeet, and some small fish.</p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_0630.jpg\" alt=\"Forward view.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_0635.jpg\" alt=\"Backward with incline.\"></p>\n<p>6 – ‘Yutskovsky Springs’. Almost the same as number one, but the water is much more pleasant:\nwithout metal in taste, slightly sweet. And there are many more points for collecting water. And\nalso the atmosphere is much mysterious – a ravine, coolness, a trail among overhanging trees…</p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_1479.jpg\" alt=\"Top down.\"></p>\n<p>And that was enough for the whole day.</p>\n<p>In general, I found something to fill my weekends with <del>not, all the same, to sit at the\ncomputer</del>. What surprised me that I enjoyed driving, especially on the highway. Very relaxing\n(almost like ETS2), but it’s dangerous at a speed of 120 km/h. I have not driven for about 10 years\n<del>I have not driven at all, except for the exam</del>, but after a day of driving, I got used to it\n(however, I had to use traffic rules app for a week to refresh my knowledge). Car rent impressions\nare spoiled by the coherence with the mobile application, such that without the Internet the car\ncannot be closed or opened. I had to call support for solving this near the “Krinitsy”. And the app\nworks strangely with 3G Internet – does not work at all. <del>I haven’t read it, but</del> I condemn.</p>\n<p>As a result, in a day I drove off 266 km and spent half a gas tank. I spent ≈$42 (105.34 BYN) on\neverything. I planned to visit other places.</p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_0648.PNG\" alt=\"Proof.\"></p>\n<p>And I was also surprised that I was able to park the car reversed normally from the first time. I\ndidn’t expect it from myself.</p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_0641.jpg\" alt=\"Parking genius.\"></p>","id":"73856f04-94d3-5eac-9753-0cdb8ac929bd"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"ITFarrier"}}},"pageContext":{"langKey":"en","language":"en","next":{"fields":{"langKey":"en","slug":"/en/blog/2021-08-12-young-toad/"},"frontmatter":{"language":null,"title":"Young toad","type":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"langKey":"en","slug":"/en/blog/2016-09-14-trinity-or-day-three/"},"frontmatter":{"language":null,"title":"Trinity or day three","type":null}},"slug":"/en/blog/2021-08-01-in-the-wake-of-the-onliner/"}},
