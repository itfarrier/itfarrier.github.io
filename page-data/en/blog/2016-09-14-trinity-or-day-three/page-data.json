I was dressed in all my clothes, sleeping in a sleeping bag\nin a fetal position on a rug in a tent. And one I’m frozen! The tent was very humid. AND VERY COLD! Somehow I forced\nmyself to get out of the sleeping bag and ate. In the process, I warmed up a little. Starting to leave the tent, I took\nmy shoes in my hands and was surprised! It was wetter than I put it to dry. I dressed everything wet. Packed my stuff\nand went out hitchhiking. The hitchhiking was unsuccessful from the word ‘absolutely’. I had to walk along the road to a\nstop, where I went from time to time to the Olzons. During this time I was traveling with a military man, in a wagon,\nwith a taxi driver, in a ‘bread truck’. Then I left the ‘bread truck’ for the first time:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 4160px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/02f3f4b0cf2be28dd0f3fe26356cf3e5/a3429/IMG_20160826_084320.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/02f3f4b0cf2be28dd0f3fe26356cf3e5/f696c/IMG_20160826_084320.avif 1920w,\n/static/02f3f4b0cf2be28dd0f3fe26356cf3e5/a5563/IMG_20160826_084320.avif 3840w,\n/static/02f3f4b0cf2be28dd0f3fe26356cf3e5/8d91f/IMG_20160826_084320.avif 4160w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 4160px) 100vw, 4160px\"\n              type=\"image/avif\"\n            /><source\n              srcset=\"/static/02f3f4b0cf2be28dd0f3fe26356cf3e5/882b9/IMG_20160826_084320.webp 1920w,\n/static/02f3f4b0cf2be28dd0f3fe26356cf3e5/93e07/IMG_20160826_084320.webp 3840w,\n/static/02f3f4b0cf2be28dd0f3fe26356cf3e5/39c10/IMG_20160826_084320.webp 4160w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 4160px) 100vw, 4160px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/02f3f4b0cf2be28dd0f3fe26356cf3e5/0f98f/IMG_20160826_084320.jpg 1920w,\n/static/02f3f4b0cf2be28dd0f3fe26356cf3e5/e6b01/IMG_20160826_084320.jpg 3840w,\n/static/02f3f4b0cf2be28dd0f3fe26356cf3e5/a3429/IMG_20160826_084320.jpg 4160w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 4160px) 100vw, 4160px\"\n            type=\"image/jpeg\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/02f3f4b0cf2be28dd0f3fe26356cf3e5/a3429/IMG_20160826_084320.jpg\"\n            alt=\"IMG 20160826 084320\"\n            title=\"\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>In Olzony the ‘bread truck’ stopped for the second time. The driver was Alexander. We rode with him to Elancy. He is\nfrom Angarsk. It was on the way in his car I understood that I was at Lake Baikal. Nature has changed, frequent passes\nbegan, beautiful views from above to the valleys. The car was aged and, when driving uphill, noticeably ‘fucked up’ from\nsuch loads. Interestingly, Sanya was fucked up too. He said that in these places for the first time in eight years,\nalthough he lives nearby. Just like me before this trip. He mentioned that he had finally found a tree for planting near\nthe house (there were different shapes, sizes, and colors). I hope that he still came there again and took the desired\ntree with him. In Elancy, I changed my clothes behind a fence, finally changed my socks (well I put on wet and leaky dry\nones below), pet a cow, which got scared and jerked away from me into a hole in the fence. The stop began unsuccessfully\nagain. I had to go further on foot. And here again the ‘bread truck’. ‘God loves the Trinity, ” said the “old\nacquaintance”. He took me to the departure from Elancy, but, alas, it did not help. I had to walk for several kilometers\nbecause of no “stoppability”. On the way, there were approximately the following landscapes:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 4160px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/34738ba21bb167ed00288df638dc1fc7/a3429/IMG_20160826_130042.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/34738ba21bb167ed00288df638dc1fc7/f696c/IMG_20160826_130042.avif 1920w,\n/static/34738ba21bb167ed00288df638dc1fc7/a5563/IMG_20160826_130042.avif 3840w,\n/static/34738ba21bb167ed00288df638dc1fc7/8d91f/IMG_20160826_130042.avif 4160w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 4160px) 100vw, 4160px\"\n              type=\"image/avif\"\n            /><source\n              srcset=\"/static/34738ba21bb167ed00288df638dc1fc7/882b9/IMG_20160826_130042.webp 1920w,\n/static/34738ba21bb167ed00288df638dc1fc7/93e07/IMG_20160826_130042.webp 3840w,\n/static/34738ba21bb167ed00288df638dc1fc7/39c10/IMG_20160826_130042.webp 4160w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 4160px) 100vw, 4160px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/34738ba21bb167ed00288df638dc1fc7/0f98f/IMG_20160826_130042.jpg 1920w,\n/static/34738ba21bb167ed00288df638dc1fc7/e6b01/IMG_20160826_130042.jpg 3840w,\n/static/34738ba21bb167ed00288df638dc1fc7/a3429/IMG_20160826_130042.jpg 4160w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 4160px) 100vw, 4160px\"\n            type=\"image/jpeg\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/34738ba21bb167ed00288df638dc1fc7/a3429/IMG_20160826_130042.jpg\"\n            alt=\"IMG 20160826 130042\"\n            title=\"\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>More than an hour later, two cars stopped.
