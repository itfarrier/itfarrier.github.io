As a result, there was a tourist town.</p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_0985.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_0996.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I also looked at the filming site of Belarusfilm. There is nothing to watch, of course.</p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_1132.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_1133.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>And here is the first love. Orsha turned out to be not as a prison as I expected. Although, far from\nthe castle, the city is very bad.</p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_1199.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_1200.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Shklov looks more like a village than a city. The feeling is that after the construction of the town\nhall in the 18th century, nothing else was done.</p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_1223.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_1220.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_1217.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Near the Shklov I saw something wonderful. But for sure from the word ‘apple’…</p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_1233.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Then I accidentally saw these ruins and had to turn around. A sign with the form of a shield\nattracted my attention. Nothing remained of the city. You can only visit this place to be sad about\nwhat we have lost.</p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_1262.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_1260.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_1280.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Another love follows. Very boring.</p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_1284.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The swamps were not so boring. Car sharing spoiled everything. I drove into the forest about 7\nmeters and suffered for a long time by blocking the car and unlocking it afterward with a good\nmobile connection. Got a lesson not to drive into the forest on a sharing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_1286.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_1297.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_1298.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_1302.jpg\" alt=\"Not mine.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_1303.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_1305.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>And finally, the city where the most interesting thing is the factory.</p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_1315.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In general, driving to all these assholes is very interesting, although you don’t see anything\ninteresting there. That’s weird.</p>","id":"ceced779-22c6-5793-8bf6-9057c6019341"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"ITFarrier"}}},"pageContext":{"langKey":"en","language":"en","next":{"fields":{"langKey":"en","slug":"/en/blog/2021-10-10-chigiri/"},"frontmatter":{"language":null,"title":"Chigiri","type":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"langKey":"en","slug":"/en/blog/2021-09-05-mustang/"},"frontmatter":{"language":null,"title":"Mustang","type":null}},"slug":"/en/blog/2021-09-06-i-love/"}},
