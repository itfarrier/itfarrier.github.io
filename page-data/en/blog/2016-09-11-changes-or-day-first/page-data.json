I put a sleeping bag into my\nschool backpack, which I have been with for more than 10 years, twisted a mat outside into its lower\nloops and hooked a ‘LENTA’ tent for almost 800 ₽ behind them, then stuffed inside all sorts of\nlittle things, such as paste‐brushes‐containers for lenses‐charging‐a little bit of the food‐hats\nand socks. My maximalism was stifled by the enlightenment of prudence and I took with me a card with\n0 ₽ in my account and 125 ₽ in cash.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 4160px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/58b3648670b2936e99b1b876b4bb116f/a3429/IMG_20160903_071525.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/58b3648670b2936e99b1b876b4bb116f/a5563/IMG_20160903_071525.avif 3840w,\n/static/58b3648670b2936e99b1b876b4bb116f/8d91f/IMG_20160903_071525.avif 4160w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 4160px) 100vw, 4160px\"\n              type=\"image/avif\"\n            /><source\n              srcset=\"/static/58b3648670b2936e99b1b876b4bb116f/93e07/IMG_20160903_071525.webp 3840w,\n/static/58b3648670b2936e99b1b876b4bb116f/39c10/IMG_20160903_071525.webp 4160w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 4160px) 100vw, 4160px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/58b3648670b2936e99b1b876b4bb116f/e6b01/IMG_20160903_071525.jpg 3840w,\n/static/58b3648670b2936e99b1b876b4bb116f/a3429/IMG_20160903_071525.jpg 4160w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 4160px) 100vw, 4160px\"\n            type=\"image/jpeg\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/58b3648670b2936e99b1b876b4bb116f/a3429/IMG_20160903_071525.jpg\"\n            alt=\"IMG 20160903 071525\"\n            title=\"IMG 20160903 071525\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>August 24th. Morning on my nerves, because I piss to go out of my ‘greenhouse’ (going somewhere,\nalmost without money, alone, for the first time in 10 years or more). I ate, got ready, said\ngoodbye, and went. It was raining outside, which went well with the holes in the soles of the\nsneakers. Naturally, my feet immediately got wet, on which I unwisely don’t care. At the bus stop\nnear the house, I decided to use the money to save time and drove for 22 rubles to the highway to\nKansk.</p>\n<p>And now it is!</p>\n<p>Without voting for 10 minutes, I was successful: I was picked up by a truck. The driver was from\n‘Central Asia’ and spoke Russian and tried to speak. I rode to Berezovka and he wished me a happy\njourney. We didn’t even know the names of each other. Then 5 minutes of waiting and the second car:\nAlexander on the wagon. I rode to Kuskunka if memory does not fail. Next 15 minutes of waiting and\n“Zhenya” on Largus. He turned out to be a hitchhiker from the 90s, already retired. Traveled almost\nall of the ex‐USSR. When he found out that I was on Baikal, he said something like: “Damn, you FUCK\nthere! The water is pure, the nature is awesome. It cannot be explained, just believe me.” He\nstrongly advised me to visit the tundra lakes and generally travel around the country. We reached\nUyar almost. Then the NAMELESS SULLEN DRIVER on the VAZ 9th. He refused to give the name and said\nthat we would ride in silence. Under the old radio were cassettes (cassettes, damn it! In 2016!)\nFrom the series “chanson, wolf”s share, my life is a tin’. We reached Kansk in silence.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 2400px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/04fcd33ca2b96b41f9c888eec77e0fd7/df51d/PANO_20160824_125025.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 25.666666666666664%;

I had to go through the whole city. It took half\na day and two calluses. Kansk turned out to be a terrible hole: a crap village, which for some\nreason has the status of a ‘city’. It was about an hour at the exit from the city, although the\nlocation was good! Then the truck stopped that took Taishet. It is interesting that the driver drove\npast me, realized that he had forgotten the goods in the store in Kansk, which he had bought, and\ndrove back, and then on the way back, he saw me a second time and, then, picked me up. We arrived at\nTaishet at almost 21 o’clock and it was already dark. I decided to spend the night and put up a tent\nunder the trees near the track. The first overnight stay!..</p>","id":"eebb103c-d30b-5c7c-98e7-8fcd7cb34787"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"ITFarrier"}}},"pageContext":{"langKey":"en","language":"en","next":{"fields":{"langKey":"en","slug":"/en/blog/2016-09-13-silence-or-day-two/"},"frontmatter":{"language":null,"title":"Silence or day two","type":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"langKey":"en","slug":"/en/blog/2016-08-19-not-expected/"},"frontmatter":{"language":null,"title":"Not expected","type":null}},"slug":"/en/blog/2016-09-11-changes-or-day-first/"}},
