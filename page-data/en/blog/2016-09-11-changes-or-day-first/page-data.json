I put a sleeping bag into my school backpack,\nwhich I have been with for more than 10 years, twisted a mat outside into its lower loops and hooked a ‘LENTA’ tent for\nalmost 800 ₽ behind them, then stuffed inside all sorts of little things, such as paste‐brushes‐containers for\nlenses‐charging‐a little bit of the food‐hats and socks. My maximalism was stifled by the enlightenment of prudence and\nI took with me a card with 0 ₽ in my account and 125 ₽ in cash.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 4160px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/58b3648670b2936e99b1b876b4bb116f/a3429/IMG_20160903_071525.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/58b3648670b2936e99b1b876b4bb116f/f696c/IMG_20160903_071525.avif 1920w,\n/static/58b3648670b2936e99b1b876b4bb116f/a5563/IMG_20160903_071525.avif 3840w,\n/static/58b3648670b2936e99b1b876b4bb116f/8d91f/IMG_20160903_071525.avif 4160w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 4160px) 100vw, 4160px\"\n              type=\"image/avif\"\n            /><source\n              srcset=\"/static/58b3648670b2936e99b1b876b4bb116f/882b9/IMG_20160903_071525.webp 1920w,\n/static/58b3648670b2936e99b1b876b4bb116f/93e07/IMG_20160903_071525.webp 3840w,\n/static/58b3648670b2936e99b1b876b4bb116f/39c10/IMG_20160903_071525.webp 4160w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 4160px) 100vw, 4160px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/58b3648670b2936e99b1b876b4bb116f/0f98f/IMG_20160903_071525.jpg 1920w,\n/static/58b3648670b2936e99b1b876b4bb116f/e6b01/IMG_20160903_071525.jpg 3840w,\n/static/58b3648670b2936e99b1b876b4bb116f/a3429/IMG_20160903_071525.jpg 4160w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 4160px) 100vw, 4160px\"\n            type=\"image/jpeg\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/58b3648670b2936e99b1b876b4bb116f/a3429/IMG_20160903_071525.jpg\"\n            alt=\"IMG 20160903 071525\"\n            title=\"\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>August 24th. Morning on my nerves, because I piss to go out of my ‘greenhouse’ (going somewhere, almost without money,\nalone, for the first time in 10 years or more). I ate, got ready, said goodbye, and went. It was raining outside, which\nwent well with the holes in the soles of the sneakers. Naturally, my feet immediately got wet, on which I unwisely don’t\ncare. At the bus stop near the house, I decided to use the money to save time and drove for 22 rubles to the highway to\nKansk.</p>\n<p>And now it is!</p>\n<p>Without voting for 10 minutes, I was successful: I was picked up by a truck. The driver was from ‘Central Asia’ and\nspoke Russian and tried to speak. I rode to Berezovka and he wished me a happy journey. We didn’t even know the names of\neach other. Then 5 minutes of waiting and the second car: Alexander on the wagon. I rode to Kuskunka if memory does not\nfail. Next 15 minutes of waiting and “Zhenya” on Largus. He turned out to be a hitchhiker from the 90s, already retired.\nTraveled almost all of the ex‐USSR. When he found out that I was on Baikal, he said something like: “Damn, you FUCK\nthere! The water is pure, the nature is awesome. It cannot be explained, just believe me.” He strongly advised me to\nvisit the tundra lakes and generally travel around the country. We reached Uyar almost. Then the NAMELESS SULLEN DRIVER\non the VAZ 9th. He refused to give the name and said that we would ride in silence. Under the old radio were cassettes\n(cassettes, damn it! In 2016!) From the series “chanson, wolf”s share, my life is a tin’. We reached Kansk in silence.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 2400px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/04fcd33ca2b96b41f9c888eec77e0fd7/df51d/PANO_20160824_125025.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 25.677083333333332%;

I had to go through the whole city. It took half a day and two\ncalluses. Kansk turned out to be a terrible hole: a crap village, which for some reason has the status of a ‘city’. It\nwas about an hour at the exit from the city, although the location was good! Then the truck stopped that took Taishet.\nIt is interesting that the driver drove past me, realized that he had forgotten the goods in the store in Kansk, which\nhe had bought, and drove back, and then on the way back, he saw me a second time and, then, picked me up. We arrived at\nTaishet at almost 21 o’clock and it was already dark. I decided to spend the night and put up a tent under the trees\nnear the track.
