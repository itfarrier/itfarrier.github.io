I ate, packed my stuff, went out on the track. 5 minutes\nand I’m in a car. An employee of the pre-trial detention center drove to the nearest cafe, where\ntruckers were supposed to be, who was not there and the cafe was closed. “Fuck, polish!” I went on\nfoot in search of a convenient place to stop (I was at the very bottom of the slope). I walked to\nthe top and got crazy because the hitchhiking didn’t flop a damn thing in a convenient place. I\ncould not stand it and go on. Having reached the junction, I walked a little further than it, and\nthere the car stopped for 10 minutes: VAZ 2109.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 4160px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/8d24bf3835c500f360fee7bd6ce5f082/a3429/IMG_20160825_121224.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAPABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQFAgb/xAAWAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgP/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAdqsyS8c8Xn/AP/EABkQAQEBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMCAQASE//aAAgBAQABBQIxCgYDnIANkNz4Uld67//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEv/aAAgBAwEBPwFmX//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEv/aAAgBAgEBPwFun//EABoQAAIDAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARAQIhgSL/2gAIAQEABj8CpM01HhmWFwxx0w//xAAaEAEAAwEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhMWHh/9oACAEBAAE/IQgK0ijLVuPHRIJcH2o+67FE5mPK1L/U/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABBQ/wD/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEWH/2gAIAQMBAT8QjJ//xAAXEQEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARFh/9oACAECAQE/EIto/8QAHBABAAMAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARITFBUWGB/9oACAEBAAE/EAyX0R2tS8QIre8DQj8jDULGlvyEMm3qFhAKi6fJ3szMJytluf/Z'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/8d24bf3835c500f360fee7bd6ce5f082/a5563/IMG_20160825_121224.avif 3840w,\n/static/8d24bf3835c500f360fee7bd6ce5f082/8d91f/IMG_20160825_121224.avif 4160w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 4160px) 100vw, 4160px\"\n              type=\"image/avif\"\n            /><source\n              srcset=\"/static/8d24bf3835c500f360fee7bd6ce5f082/93e07/IMG_20160825_121224.webp 3840w,\n/static/8d24bf3835c500f360fee7bd6ce5f082/39c10/IMG_20160825_121224.webp 4160w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 4160px) 100vw, 4160px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/8d24bf3835c500f360fee7bd6ce5f082/e6b01/IMG_20160825_121224.jpg 3840w,\n/static/8d24bf3835c500f360fee7bd6ce5f082/a3429/IMG_20160825_121224.jpg 4160w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 4160px) 100vw, 4160px\"\n            type=\"image/jpeg\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/8d24bf3835c500f360fee7bd6ce5f082/a3429/IMG_20160825_121224.jpg\"\n            alt=\"IMG 20160825 121224\"\n            title=\"IMG 20160825 121224\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>The driver was Buryat Nikolai (he is in the photo), who left his native Ulan-Ude to Sverdlovsk.

At the bus stop, I asked a stranger\n(she was beautiful, by the way, that’s why I came up) if I had decided everything correctly with\nroute 13. She replied that yes, everything is correct and that she was going to the northern exit of\nthe city too. As a result, we got to talking and drove off together. Her name is Natalia. After\ntalking with me, she knew that I hitchhiked, quit my job, and left the fuck out another, she also\ncaught fire, but noticed that a family with three children and a husband would interfere with this\n(I was surprised, of course, about myself, what a beautiful woman at the age who still gave birth\nthree children). I also noticed a decent number of women in hijabs (there is no such shit in\nKrasnoyarsk). Leaving the bus (by the way, she paid 15 rubles for the fare for me), we reached her\nwork, where I refilled the water supply and in parting, she gave me some fresh vegetables, which\nwere eaten in the next half hour.</p>\n<p>Having walked a little, I found myself at the beginning of the Kachugsky tract. I was just walking\nalong the broken curb when the car in front of me stopped (and I didn’t vote) and turned on the\nemergency. I thought that was for me. I came up to the driver’s door and made sure that it was. We\nwent to the village of Oyok. Unfortunately, I forgot the driver’s name. I got out at the\nintersection of the P-418 highway and the road to the mentioned Oyok. The time was already over 20\nhours. I tried to vote and did not succeed. I put up a tent about 50 meters from the road. Before\ngoing to bed I put on my sneakers, and socks to dry. I ate, read and… The second night began and the\nlast one on the way to the festival.</p>","id":"92904830-9e1c-5a63-a5d8-ca1356406659"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"ITFarrier"}}},"pageContext":{"langKey":"en","language":"en","next":{"fields":{"langKey":"en","slug":"/en/blog/2016-09-14-troitsa-ili-dien'-trietii/"},"frontmatter":{"language":null,"title":"Trinity or day three","type":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"langKey":"en","slug":"/en/blog/2016-09-11-pieriemieny-ili-dien'-piervyi/"},"frontmatter":{"language":null,"title":"Changes or day first","type":null}},"slug":"/en/blog/2016-09-13-molchaniie-ili-dien'-vtoroi/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2448238595","3823719399"]}
