Just take pictures with streams of water. On the leeward\nside, the heat transferred to the air from the water is clearly felt. As a result, there is a\nbizarre sensation of heat from the wind and simultaneous coolness from the drops that fly to you.</p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_0825.JPG\" alt=\"In streams of heat and coolness.\"></p>\n<p>Then I rushed to Logoisk park. Water lilies met me.</p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_0831.JPG\" alt=\"Hi.\"></p>\n<p>Then ducks appeared, which are almost not afraid of people.</p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_0837.JPG\" alt=\"Give me food.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_0848.JPG\" alt=\"On distribution.\"></p>\n<p>In the deep of the park, there are cool cascades in the hollow. I wish I could be here during the\nfog. It should be creepy.</p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_0856.JPG\" alt=\"Not scary.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_0872.JPG\" alt=\"Eye.\"></p>\n<p>And then I remembered that I had never been to Khatyn.</p>\n<p>Upon arrival, the size of the parking is striking. It is huge.</p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_0888.JPG\" alt=\"At the entrance.\"></p>\n<p>And then you understand the scale of the whole complex when you see the main alley.</p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_0889.JPG\" alt=\"Until the skyline.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_0902.JPG\" alt=\"The reason for the memorial.\"></p>\n<p>When you walk, you start to hear bells ringing. At first, I thought that it seemed to me. But, no,\nit repeats itself and gets louder as you go through the alley.</p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_0920.JPG\" alt=\"And here is one of the culprits of the ringing.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_0921.JPG\" alt=\"Such ‘gifts’ are almost near each of them.\"></p>\n<p>The ringing, of course, creates the necessary feelings, instills some kind of anxiety. And in\ncombination with the reading of the names of the victims, it is terrifying.</p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_0919.JPG\" alt=\"Scale.\"></p>\n<p>In general, this is so far the only place where there is infrastructure: parking, navigation,\ntoilets, where they regularly clean and keep everything in order. It is very pleasant to visit just\nsuch places, you know right away. It would be like this everywhere in Belarus…</p>\n<p><img src=\"IMG_0925.JPG\" alt=\"It would be so everywhere.\"></p>","id":"0d4fe79a-39d1-538a-8d15-c85e05b28866"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"ITFarrier"}}},"pageContext":{"langKey":"en","language":"en","next":{"fields":{"langKey":"en","slug":"/en/blog/2021-08-28-sputnik-v/"},"frontmatter":{"language":null,"title":"Sputnik V","type":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"langKey":"en","slug":"/en/blog/2021-08-12-young-toad/"},"frontmatter":{"language":null,"title":"Young toad","type":null}},"slug":"/en/blog/2021-08-16-amazement/"}},
