For work. For my\nbeloved. The trip was quite ordinary: the driver suffered, and I slept, ate, listened to music while lying in the back\nseat of the VAZ 6th. Somewhere in the middle of the way, the car made several small jerks on the move – gasoline runs\nout, the driver said. After some time, it really ended. Fuck it if there was a gas station nearby, but it was 8 km from\nus. And it was already getting dark. And the car stopped just at the beginning of the ascent. The driver, laughing and\nmocking, issued: “Well, what a couchsurfer, catch the car! You want to hitchhike, so you will try! \" So, picked up\na canister (empty, which was empty in the trunk, although it should be full for such cases, damn it!) And went in the\ndirection of the gas station, trying to catch a ride. 10 cars passed by and I had already managed to climb the mountain,\nunder which we stopped at the emergency. TOYOTA suddenly stopped (here it is, the first hitchhiking)! The driver was\ngreeted, I said that I need to get to the nearest gas station, which is 8 kilometers further along the way, the driver\nagreed, I sat down and we drove off. And the conversation began:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>― Is that your car there on the emergency gang?</p>\n<p>― Yes.</p>\n<p>― And what happened?</p>\n<p>― Gasoline ran out. And the canister in the trunk was empty. So, here we are.</p>\n<p>― Shit happens.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, it happens, although it shouldn’t, damn it! What the fuck did I give this unfortunate driver a canister? For the\ngoing at night with the same canister for gasoline? I don’t remember the course of further conversation, but it turned\nout that the Toyota driver was also going to Novokuznetsk. And also from Krasnoyarsk. And also for work. What a\nsuspicious coincidence…</p>\n<p>I arrived. Said goodbye. I thanked. Released.</p>\n<p>I bought gasoline at the gas station and went back. There were two trucks in the parking, but unfortunately, both with\nturned off engines. Began trying to stop the second car in my life. No sooner had 4 cars passed me than one of the\ntrucks showed signs of life: the light came on in the cockpit, the headlights also came to life. Something clicked in my\nhead and I went to the truck. I knocked on the door and the driver lowered the side window, and I already climbed onto\nthe step. Having said that I need to get to the car, which ran out of fuel, further along, the road, I received the\nanswer that if the car is on the rise, then I will not get lucky. Fortunately for me, the car was just standing on the\ndescent, because it was on the rise when I was driving to the gas station. In general, I sat down and drove off. It was\nthe first time in my life when I found myself in the cab of a KENWORTH truck (which is like truckers from American films\nwith a huge hood and almost a house behind the driver’s seat). I was surprised that it was on the automatic\ntransmission. What can I say, compared to the VAZ 6th, the truck rides much softer and even our shitty roads seem very\nsmooth. Again, we talked a little: the trucker does not take hitchhikers (Irritated him already!), But he took me\nbecause it was necessary to help on the roads. This ended the communication. We reached our unfortunate VAZ and on\ngetting out of the truck I saw the surprised and joyful face of a friend who threw out: “The monkey arrived in the\ntruck! Absolutely fucked up!” The whole “adventure” took less than half an hour. Here’s a hitchhiking. Well, about\nCouchsurfing sometime later.</p>","id":"9243208b-f44d-5fd2-b234-318c76d4e2d7"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"ITFarrier"}}},"pageContext":{"langKey":"en","language":"en","next":{"fields":{"langKey":"en","slug":"/en/blog/2016-09-11-changes-or-day-first/"},"frontmatter":{"language":null,"title":"Changes or day first","type":"post"}},"previous":{"fields":{"langKey":"en","slug":"/en/blog/2016-07-17-tatyshev-island-festival/"},"frontmatter":{"language":null,"title":"Tatyshev island festival","type":"post"}},"slug":"/en/blog/2016-08-19-not-expected/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2674376943","357539041","4035578580"],"slicesMap":{}}
