For work. For my beloved. The trip was quite ordinary: the driver suffered, and I\nslept, ate, listened to music while lying in the back seat of the VAZ 6th. Somewhere in the middle\nof the way, the car made several small jerks on the move – gasoline runs out, the driver said. After\nsome time, it really ended. Fuck it if there was a gas station nearby, but it was 8 km from us. And\nit was already getting dark. And the car stopped just at the beginning of the ascent. The driver,\nlaughing and mocking, issued: “Well, what a couchsurfer, catch the car! You want to hitchhike, so\nyou will try! \" So, picked up a canister (empty, which was empty in the trunk, although it\nshould be full for such cases, damn it!) And went in the direction of the gas station, trying to\ncatch a ride. 10 cars passed by and I had already managed to climb the mountain, under which we\nstopped at the emergency. TOYOTA suddenly stopped (here it is, the first hitchhiking)! The driver\nwas greeted, I said that I need to get to the nearest gas station, which is 8 kilometers further\nalong the way, the driver agreed, I sat down and we drove off. And the conversation began:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>― Is that your car there on the emergency gang?</p>\n<p>― Yes.</p>\n<p>― And what happened?</p>\n<p>― Gasoline ran out. And the canister in the trunk was empty. So, here we are.</p>\n<p>― Shit happens.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, it happens, although it shouldn’t, damn it! What the fuck did I give this unfortunate driver a\ncanister? For the going at night with the same canister for gasoline? I don’t remember the course of\nfurther conversation, but it turned out that the Toyota driver was also going to Novokuznetsk. And\nalso from Krasnoyarsk. And also for work. What a suspicious coincidence…</p>\n<p>I arrived. Said goodbye. I thanked. Released.</p>\n<p>I bought gasoline at the gas station and went back. There were two trucks in the parking, but\nunfortunately, both with turned off engines. Began trying to stop the second car in my life. No\nsooner had 4 cars passed me than one of the trucks showed signs of life: the light came on in the\ncockpit, the headlights also came to life. Something clicked in my head and I went to the truck. I\nknocked on the door and the driver lowered the side window, and I already climbed onto the step.\nHaving said that I need to get to the car, which ran out of fuel, further along, the road, I\nreceived the answer that if the car is on the rise, then I will not get lucky. Fortunately for me,\nthe car was just standing on the descent, because it was on the rise when I was driving to the gas\nstation. In general, I sat down and drove off. It was the first time in my life when I found myself\nin the cab of a KENWORTH truck (which is like truckers from American films with a huge hood and\nalmost a house behind the driver’s seat). I was surprised that it was on the automatic transmission.\nWhat can I say, compared to the VAZ 6th, the truck rides much softer and even our shitty roads seem\nvery smooth. Again, we talked a little: the trucker does not take hitchhikers (Irritated him\nalready!), But he took me because it was necessary to help on the roads. This ended the\ncommunication. We reached our unfortunate VAZ and on getting out of the truck I saw the surprised\nand joyful face of a friend who threw out: “The monkey arrived in the truck! Absolutely fucked up!”\nThe whole “adventure” took less than half an hour. Here’s a hitchhiking. Well, about Couchsurfing\nsometime later.</p>","id":"9243208b-f44d-5fd2-b234-318c76d4e2d7"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"🇺🇦 #nowar #noputin #nolukashenko #нетвойне #нетпутину #нетлукашенко ITFarrier"}}},"pageContext":{"langKey":"en","language":"en","next":{"fields":{"langKey":"en","slug":"/en/blog/2016-09-11-changes-or-day-first/"},"frontmatter":{"language":null,"title":"Changes or day first","type":"post"}},"previous":{"fields":{"langKey":"en","slug":"/en/blog/2016-07-17-tatyshev-island-festival/"},"frontmatter":{"language":null,"title":"Tatyshev island festival","type":"post"}},"slug":"/en/blog/2016-08-19-not-expected/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2674376943","357539041","4035578580"]}
