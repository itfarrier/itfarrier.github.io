So, where’s the start? From blog hostings, of course. But\nthat’s not for Jedi. I want MY OWN blog with my own domain name. Denied. Further, sure,\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org\">Wordpress</a>. Tried all of this under the light of the\n<abbr title=\"LAMP = Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP\">LAMP</abbr>: chosen the theme, installed some\nplugins. Need a hosting. And here I understood that I don’t want to pay ’cause I’m poor. And I\nstarted looking for a freeway.</p>\n<p>I invented some ways: free hosting or on my own PC. Free hostings scared my paranoia. LAMP remote\nsetup on my own PC was to difficult for me. And I found in Google that I can use\n<a href=\"https://github.com\">GitHub</a> as a hosting. And galloped… Static site generator\n<a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com\">Jekyll</a> was googled. Tried. Beautiful, free, but difficult. Let’s google\nagain… And I found <a href=\"https://octopress.org\">Octopress</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/ruhoh/ruhoh.rb\">Ruhoh</a>,\n<a href=\"https://hexo.io\">Hexo</a> as special static site generators for blogs. Let’s roll.</p>\n<p>Ruhoh seemed complicated to me again – too little <del>wallpapers</del> themes. Hexo – I had problems with\n<a href=\"https://nodejs.org\">Node.js</a> on my OS (probably problems with /dev/hands). I choosed Octopress as a\nresult. Many plugins out of the box and good default theme with huge amount community themes and\nplugins.</p>\n<p>So, free hosting on GitHub (and all benefits from this huge project), beautiful HTML5 + CSS3\nwebsite, fast and reliable ’cause of its static nature.</p>","id":"5939296b-3442-5e17-8237-ffbdbd35de1a"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"ITFarrier"}}},"pageContext":{"langKey":"en","language":"en","next":{"fields":{"langKey":"en","slug":"/en/blog/2014-02-21-about-isps/"},"frontmatter":{"language":null,"title":"About ISPs","type":null}},"previous":null,"slug":"/en/blog/2013-12-16-first/"}},
