(2013) – I watched this movie again. And it’s cool. This movie is a warning for newlyweds (sic!) how their\nwedding shouldn’t look like.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wild Tales (2014) – This movie is very good for me. Plot and other details better to see in wiki. I immediately\nremembered “The Voroshilov Sharpshooter” by Govorukhin, “1210” by Gonchukov and “Law Abiding Citizen” with Butler.\nGenerally, the main thought in all novels – person actions in extreme situation. Pros, in my opinion, in this almanac\nis not <del>146</del>100% tragedy in each novel: it contains happy, fun and fantastic. In fun, I suppose, author compared\nheroes with ovises (Hello, “Modern Times”). So stupid it started, continued and finished. You should see.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hardcore Henry (2015) – So, I looked at what I had been waiting for so long. In short, everything is awesome except\nfor the plot. In my opinion, it is precisely the “firstpersoness” that action films lack. This trick was hooked even\nin that bad movie “Doom” based on the cool game. And here the whole film is like a shooter! In some moments my head\nwas spinning, in others, there was too much shaking. I think this technique will be used more often now because\n“Hardcore Henry” paved the way, which ended not very successfully due to no plot. But it looked original.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Red Ghost (2020) – The authors have the balls to make a movie about WW2 with notes of Leone and Tarantino. After\nall that patriotic shit, this is a diamond.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>","id":"803eef2b-b4f6-5949-9424-1cca96b5966a"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"ITFarrier"}}},"pageContext":{"langKey":"en","language":"en","slug":"/en/videos/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2674376943","357539041","4035578580"],"slicesMap":{}}
