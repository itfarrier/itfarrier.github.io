(2013) – I watched this movie again. And it’s cool. This movie is a warning for newlyweds\n(sic!) how their wedding shouldn’t look like.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wild Tales (2014) – This movie is very good for me. Plot and other details better to see in wiki.\nI immediately remembered “The Voroshilov Sharpshooter” by Govorukhin, “1210” by Gonchukov and “Law\nAbiding Citizen” with Butler. Generally, the main thought in all novels – person actions in\nextreme situation. Pros, in my opinion, in this almanac is not <del>146</del>100% tragedy in each novel:\nit contains happy, fun and fantastic. In fun, I suppose, author compared heroes with ovises\n(Hello, “Modern Times”). So stupid it started, continued and finished. You should see.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hardcore Henry (2015) – So, I looked at what I had been waiting for so long. In short, everything\nis awesome except for the plot. In my opinion, it is precisely the “firstpersoness” that action\nfilms lack. This trick was hooked even in that bad movie “Doom” based on the cool game. And here\nthe whole film is like a shooter! In some moments my head was spinning, in others, there was too\nmuch shaking. I think this technique will be used more often now because “Hardcore Henry” paved\nthe way, which ended not very successfully due to no plot. But it looked original.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Red Ghost (2020) – The authors have the balls to make a movie about WW2 with notes of Leone\nand Tarantino. After all that patriotic shit, this is a diamond.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>","id":"803eef2b-b4f6-5949-9424-1cca96b5966a"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"🇺🇦 #nowar #noputin #nolukashenko #нетвойне #нетпутину #нетлукашенко ITFarrier"}}},"pageContext":{"langKey":"en","language":"en","slug":"/en/videos/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2674376943","357539041","4035578580"]}
