He is not common. Then everyone would be with $1.7BN.</li>\n<li>Oleg Tinkov – «How to become a businessman» (2012): Liked.</li>\n<li>Dossie Easton – «The Ethical Slut» (2007): Fucking «sofa» psychology again. But I agree with the main idea.</li>\n<li>Sergej Viktorovich Jarov – «Everyday life of besieged Leningrad» (2013): A lot of reasoning, analysis, the author’s\nattitude to documents. Don’t like.</li>\n<li>Lidija Alekseevna Nevzorova – «School’s trimming theory and practice» (2010): Disagree that «shod horses must not be\nhealthy». A farrier should read this to know the enemy in his face. The book has many colored illustrations and this\nis very good. And too many PATHOS: School, School’s Trimming Theory, School’s Method… Ugh!</li>\n<li>Lidija Alekseevna Nevzorova – «How to achieve balance» (2009): The same. PATHOS, shoeing is evil. But written very\ngood about the balance: anyone should understand.</li>\n<li>Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov – «Russian general memoirs» (2014): Very interesting. Horrors of war described very gently:\n«up to 400 souls of all ages and both sexes were massacred with the loss of two people». There is also criticism of\nYermolov from his contemporaries, which does not make him so ideal.</li>\n<li>Dean McLaughlin – «Hawk Among the Sparrows» (1992): An unobtrusive science fiction novella about the weapons of the\nfuture against the weapons of the past. The main idea: «All in good time».</li>\n<li>Sergei Donatovich Dovlatov – «Pushkin Hills» (2016): Venechka is not on the train. And no recipes.</li>\n<li>Sergei Donatovich Dovlatov – «The Zone: A Prison Camp Guard's Story» (1982): Boredom. It is written about people, not\nabout the zone. But I read it anyway.</li>\n<li>Anton Viktorovich Krotov – «Practice of free travels» (2015): A very useful book not only for a hitchhiker but also\nfor any person, interestingly written.</li>\n<li>Andrzej Sapkowski – «The Witcher»: Good fantasy.</li>\n<li>Alexandre Dumas — «The Count of Monte Cristo» (2021, translation from French by L. Olavskaya and V. Stroev): Classic.\nThe plot, of course, cool, but too much descriptions with gentle talk between characters and the action is too slow.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Failed:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Andrei Andreyevich Gromyko – «Memoirs» (1988): I finished only one volume. It’s very interesting, but it’s too boring.\nLike the Bible. I thought about Soviet politicians, like Novoseltsev: «…you are a rusk!…There is nothing human in\nyou!…There is no heart in you because you have only numbers and reports…». This book showed me that at least Gromyko\nwas a very interesting person.</li>\n<li>Thomas Metzinger – «The Ego Tunnel»: Tired on page 21, too difficult for me.</li>\n</ul>","id":"90007bee-39ab-57c9-b84b-4dd44c2697be"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"ITFarrier"}}},"pageContext":{"langKey":"en","language":"en","slug":"/en/books/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2674376943","357539041","4035578580"],"slicesMap":{}}
