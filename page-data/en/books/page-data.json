He is not common. Then everyone would\nbe with $1.7BN.</li>\n<li>Oleg Tinkov – «How to become a businessman» (2012): Liked.</li>\n<li>Dossie Easton – «The Ethical Slut» (2007): Fucking «sofa» psychology again. But I agree with the\nmain idea.</li>\n<li>Sergej Viktorovich Jarov – «Everyday life of besieged Leningrad» (2013): A lot of reasoning,\nanalysis, the author’s attitude to documents. Don’t like.</li>\n<li>Lidija Alekseevna Nevzorova – «School’s trimming theory and practice» (2010): Disagree that «shod\nhorses must not be healthy». A farrier should read this to know the enemy in his face. The book\nhas many colored illustrations and this is very good. And too many PATHOS: School, School’s\nTrimming Theory, School’s Method… Ugh!</li>\n<li>Lidija Alekseevna Nevzorova – «How to achieve balance» (2009): The same. PATHOS, shoeing is evil.\nBut written very good about the balance: anyone should understand.</li>\n<li>Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov – «Russian general memoirs» (2014): Very interesting. Horrors of war\ndescribed very gently: «up to 400 souls of all ages and both sexes were massacred with the loss of\ntwo people». There is also criticism of Yermolov from his contemporaries, which does not make him\nso ideal.</li>\n<li>Dean McLaughlin – «Hawk Among the Sparrows» (1992): An unobtrusive science fiction novella about\nthe weapons of the future against the weapons of the past. The main idea: «All in good time».</li>\n<li>Sergei Donatovich Dovlatov – «Pushkin Hills» (2016): Venechka is not on the train. And no recipes.</li>\n<li>Sergei Donatovich Dovlatov – «The Zone: A Prison Camp Guard's Story» (1982): Boredom. It is\nwritten about people, not about the zone. But I read it anyway.</li>\n<li>Anton Viktorovich Krotov – «Practice of free travels» (2015): A very useful book not only for a\nhitchhiker but also for any person, interestingly written.</li>\n<li>Andrzej Sapkowski – «The Witcher»: Good fantasy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Failed:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Andrei Andreyevich Gromyko – «Memoirs» (1988): I finished only one volume. It’s very interesting,\nbut it’s too boring. Like the Bible. I thought about Soviet politicians, like Novoseltsev: «…you\nare a rusk!…There is nothing human in you!…There is no heart in you because you have only numbers\nand reports…». This book showed me that at least Gromyko was a very interesting person.</li>\n<li>Thomas Metzinger – «The Ego Tunnel»: Tired on page 21, too difficult for me.</li>\n</ul>","id":"90007bee-39ab-57c9-b84b-4dd44c2697be"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"#nowar #noputin #nolukashenko #нетвойне #нетпутину #нетлукашенко ITFarrier"}}},"pageContext":{"langKey":"en","language":"en","slug":"/en/books/"}},
